# NSC-R_tidy_tuesday_20230509
Materials to support the NSC-R Tidy Tuesday workshop of May 9, 2023

The Quarto script "regression_spotify.qmd" contains the annotated script for the workshop after some debugging and improvements.
The file "regression_spotify.html" is its rendered HTML version. You can easily copy code chunck from it if that is the way you prefer to work.

The file "get_started.R" is a short script to get going with your own analysis of these data.

The CSV files are output from the cide chuncks in "regression_spotify.qmd".
